Unless you have a specific need to work with an existing installation, choosing a PostgreSQL version of 12 or higher is best.\n"

The speed advantages of asynchronous adapters will not be shown strongly until you work with much larger data sets than this. And especially once you have many queries \"in flight* at the same time. However, your task is to time differences in performance of a relatively expensive query that utilizes nested subqueries.  A similar query is discussed passingly in the next lesson.\n",

You may with to write and time scripts at the command line, since within Jupyter, you need to use the trick discussed to nest an asyncio loop within Jupyter's own loop.  More adventurous students should try much larger data sets and more complex queries that they have access to.  Moreover, you may wish to try `uvloop` rather than `asyncio` to speed up slow interfaces even more."
